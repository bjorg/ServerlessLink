Serverless link is a Serverless URL Shortener build on [ÂµServerless](https://github.com/onema/uServerless) and [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
and deployed using the [serverless framework](https://serverless.com).

## Demo
**Checkout the [ServerlessLink](http://serverless.link) website for a demo!**

## Requirements
1. java JDK `8+` ([download](https://www.java.com/en/download/))
1. sbt `1+` ([install](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Setup.html))
1. Serverless Framework `1.30+` ([install](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/))

#### Optional
1. python `3.6+` ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
  * This is used to install the AWS CLI and move the website assets into the S3 bucket

### Using docker
Alternatively you can use the `onema/userverless-build` docker container to build and deploy your application:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $HOME/.aws/:/root/.aws/ -v $PWD:/root/app onema/userverless-build bash
```

## Setup
### Create the assembly

```bash
sbt assembly
```

### Deploy the code using serverless

```
serverless deploy --domain <DOMAIN_NAME>
```
The <DOMAIN_NAME> is the domain you will be using for your application. This will create a bucket with the given domain name
and create two DNS Record Sets in Route 53, one for the website and another one for the API.

Serverless will use the file `infrastructure/link-resources_cfn.yml` and generate the following resources:

* Website Bucket (to place the application files)
* DynamoDB table (where the link mappings are saved)
* ACM certificate for the Website
* ACM certificate for the API 
* Domain Mapping for the API (the domain will be `m.<DOMAIN_NAME>`)
* CloudFront distribution for the website
* Record set entry in Route 53 for the website
* Record set entry in Route 53 for the API

> **IMPORTANT**:
> 
> The process will not finished until the ACM Certificates have been approved, the approval process requires a DNS entry, 
> you can see the instructions to add the DNS record in the [ACM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1#) control panel.  

### To push the code to the bucket use the following command

```bash
aws s3 cp ./public/ s3://<DOMAIN_NAME> --recursive
```

### DNS Setup
You need a Route 53 hosted zone for the domain that you will be using in this project. This project assumes that 
you will be using a second-level domain name e.g. `test.com` as this name is used to look up the Route 53 hosted zone.
If you want to use a sub-domain e.g. link.test.com, you will need to modify the resources `WebsiteDomainRecordSet` and 
 `ApiDomainRecordSet` in the `link-resources_cfn.yml` file to use the proper  `HostedZoneName` or `HostedZoneId`.
 See [AWS::Route53::RecordSet][1] and [Alias Resource Record Set for a CloudFront Distribution][2] for more information

[2]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/quickref-route53.html#w2ab1c17c23c81c11

## Application configuration
The application needs a `config.js` file. You can copy the `public/js/dist.config.js` to `public/js/config.js`. At this time
all you need to fill in is the name of the `invokeUrl` which is the URL of your API `m.<DOMAIN_NAME>`, and the scheme, this should be `https`.

## Route 53 configuration 
Once you have your API gateway and S3 buckets in place, you should create domains names in route 53 for your static website 
(must match the domain name you gave to the serverless application) and  the api gateway domain.

## Optional setup Build/Deploy service for your application
I have included a cloud formation template `infrastructure/code-build-cicd_cfn.yml` to generate a CodeBuild service. 
This service can be used to deployed your serverless application  any time you push code to a branch in your GitHub repository 
(the branch is defined in the template parameters).
